StreamSets Data Collector is an enterprise grade, open source, continuous big data ingestion infrastructure.
It has an advanced and easy to use User Interface that lets data scientists, developers and data infrastructure
teams easily create data pipelines in a fraction of the time typically required to create complex ingest scenarios.
Out of the box, StreamSets Data Collector reads from and writes to a
large number of end-points, including S3, JDBC, Hadoop, Kafka,
Cassandra and many others. You can use Python, Javascript and Java Expression Language in addition to a large number
of pre-built stages to transform and process the data on the fly. For fault tolerance
and scale out, you can setup data pipelines in cluster mode and perform fine grained monitoring at every stage of
the pipeline.
